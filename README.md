🌱 Disclosing a repository intended to share early-stage independent research with the GitHub Education community and beyond.
<p>
<br> 🙇🏿‍♂️ Much of my original intention for this repository is to progress by sharing scripts and source code.
<p>
<br> ⚓ I may also share PDF versions of the underlying pre-print paper prior to its submission to a conference or a pre-print server.
<p>
<br> 🌟 Ideas for articles may include dynamic stochastic modelling, econometric forecasting, and regression analysis using Python-based software.
