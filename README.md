I am aiming to pursue a DPhil in Industrial Relations. I graduated Magna Cum Laude (Dominant Quality) in Management Studies from the University of Essex (2010) and also hold a Postgraduate Certificate in the field of Financial Econometrics obtained from the University of Essex (2013). I am studying for the MSc in Human Resource Management (HRM) at The Open University's triple-accredited Business School, which is part of the University's Faculty of Business and Law.
