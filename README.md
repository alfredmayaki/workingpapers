🌱 Sharing a repository for the purposes of disclosing early stage indepedent research with the Github Education community and beyond.
🙇🏿‍♂️ Much of my original intention for this repository is to progress by sharing scripts and source code.
⚓ I may also share PDF versions of the underlying pre-print paper prior to its submission to conference or a pre-print server.
🌟 Ideas for articles may include dynamic stochastic modelling, econometric forecasting and regression analysis using Python-based software.
